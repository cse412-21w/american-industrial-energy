        <h3>Carbon dioxide emissions, concentrations, and temperature</h3>
        <div id="co2_temp"></div>

        <p>Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century, the
          consumption of fossil fuels for the production of energy has steadily and nearly exponentially risen,
          and along with it the emissions of carbon dioxide.
          <br>
          Future emissions will depend on international treaties, national policies,
          and individual behavior.
          <br>
        <p>Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide have
          led to a steady rise in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 from about 278 ppm
          before the Industrial Revolution to about 414 ppm in 2020.
          <br>
          Future concentrations depend on the emissions pathway chosen by humankind.
          <br>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas. Its increasing concentration has led to
          an increase in temperatures across the globe.
          <br>
          Future temperatures will depend on the emissions pathway.
          <br>
          Shown are global average temperatures in degrees Celsius
          relative to their average between 1986 and 2005.
          <br>
          The goal of the Paris Agreement (2015) is to limit global warming to well below 2,
          preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.
          <br>Only the low and medium low emission paths will meet this goal.

        <h3>Carbon dioxide emissions by fuel type:</h3>
        <div id="co2_by_fuel"></div>
        <p>The amount of CO2 per energy produced depends on the type of fuel. It is given
          here in units of pounds of CO2 emitted per million British Thermal Units (BTU).
          <br>
          The higher the hydrogen to carbon ratio in the fuel, the lower the CO2 emissions.
          Coal is primarily carbon, whereas natural gas (methane, CH4) has an H:C ratio of 4.
          Replacing coal-fired power plants with gas-fired ones cuts CO2 emissions by
          almost 50 percent for the same amount of energy produced.
          <br>Electricity generation from nuclear power plants and renewable energy
          (hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal) does not cause CO2 emissions at the
          time of electricity generation, but is usually associated with indirect emissions,
          either from producing wind turbines or solar panels, or during the mining and
          processing of uranium fuel.

        Electricity generation, industry, and agriculture combined are responsible for about
        60 % of total CO2 emissions in the US (values for 2018).
        <br>
        Therefore, we will focus on these sectors in the following.
